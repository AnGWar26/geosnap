# SUVIZ

This directory holds files and scripts that are exploring the integration of Su Han's visualization prototypes.

We will be building out jupyter notebooks for each view for geosnap. More specifically, the notebook will interface between geosnaps data and analytic components, and build the html and data pages that generate Su's prototypes.

The notebooks will also launch the new pages using `webbrowser.open(url)` where `url` is the path the generated files.

You will need LTDB_data_availability.xlsx when you enter variables and years on jupter notebook in the Python2Html
